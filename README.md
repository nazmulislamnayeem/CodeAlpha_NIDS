## üõ°Ô∏èNetwork Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)
This project is submitted as part of CodeAlpha Cybersecurity Internship Task 4. It demonstrates the setup and configuration of a network-based intrusion detection system using Snort on Kali Linux to monitor and detect suspicious/malicious activities on a network.


## üîç Project Objectives
Create and apply custom rules to detect malicious traffic.

Monitor a specific network interface (eth0).

Generate alerts when suspicious activity is detected.

Visualize attack logs using alert output.


## üñ•Ô∏è Platform Used
OS: Kali Linux (main)

Tool: Snort++ v3.1.82.0

Network Interface: eth0

Files: custom.rules (for alerts), Snort configuration (snort.lua)


## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Kali Linux)

1. First, make sure your system is updated:

sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

2. Install Snort:

sudo apt install snort -y

3. Check installed version:

snort -V

4. Navigate to your working directory:

cd ~/CodeAlpha_NIDS

5. Create custom.rules file and write detection rules inside.

## Run Snort with:

sudo snort -c /etc/snort/snort.lua -R ./custom.rules -i eth0 -A alert_fast

## üíª Windows Support (Optional)
If you want to run this project in Windows:

1. Install Npcap: https://npcap.com/#download

2. Install Snort for Windows: https://www.snort.org/downloads

Place the same custom.rules file in Snort‚Äôs rules directory.


## Run from cmd (replace interface name accordingly):

snort.exe -c snort.lua -R custom.rules -i 1 -A alert_fast

‚ö† Note: Kali is preferred for easier configuration and better output in terminal.


## üìú Detection Rules Included:

ICMP (Ping) detection

Telnet connection attempt

Nmap SYN scan

Suspicious payload (e.g., "malware")

Netcat usage detection

Shell command access
